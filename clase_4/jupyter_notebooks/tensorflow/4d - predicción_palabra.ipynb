And all the people that come and go Stop and say \"Hello\". On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, And little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass, And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It\\'s a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. A four of fish and finger pies In summer. Meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she\\'s in a play, She is anyway. In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim, And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain - very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies Penny Lane!
